            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It will be no Excuſe for the Commons now in Parliament to ſay, They had not time for Deliberation in this great Matter, as was uſual in other Parliaments, when Speakers were Elected upon their firſt Meeting in Parliament: Therefore a more deliberate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection will he expected from you after this time for Contemplation.

                     <p>THat, Whereas the Sum of Five hundred eighty four thouſand nine hundred ſeventy Eight Pounds, Two ſhillings, Two Pence, was raiſed by an Act of Parliament for the ſpeedy Building of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Ships of War, and thereby appropriated to the ſaid Uſe; By which Act it was particularly directed, That the Treaſurer of the Navy ſhould keep all moneys payed to him by vertue of the ſaid Act diſtinct and appart from all other moneys, and ſhould Iſſue and pay the ſame by Warrant of the Principal Officers and Commiſſioners of the Navy or any three or more of them; and mentioning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing that it is for the Building, for the Guns, Rigging and other Furniſhing of the ſaid Thirty Ships of War, and to no other Uſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or purpoſe whatſoever, He the ſaid <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> on or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year One thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy ſeven, being then Treaſurer of the Navy, did, contrary to the ſaid Act, and contrary to the Duty of his ſaid Office, lend the Sum of Ninty thouſand
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:187922:34"/>Pound (at Eight pound <hi>per Cent.</hi>) parcel of the ſaid Sum raiſed by the ſaid Act (being then in his hands) for and towards the ſupport and continuance of the Army then Raiſed; after ſuch time as by an Act of Parliament the ſaid Army ought to have been Disbanded, whereby the ſaid two ſeveral Acts were Eluded, and the ſaid Army was continued and kept on foot to the great Diſturbance, Hazard and Danger of the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom; And the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was afterwards put to a new Charge of raiſing and paying the ſum of Two hundred thouſand pound for the Disbanding of the ſaid Army.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That whereas an Act of Parliament had paſſed for Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of money by a Poll, for Enabling His Majeſty to enter into an actual War againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Money raiſed by Vertue of the ſaid Act, was thereby appropriated to the ſaid Uſe, and to the Re-payment of ſuch Perſons as ſhould furniſh His Majeſty with any Sums of mony, or any Stores neceſſary for the ſaid Service.</p>
                     <p>And whereas certain Eaſt-land Merchants were deſired by His Majeſties Officers to furniſh and ſupply great quantities of Stores for the Navy, and as an Incouragement thereunto, were aſſured, that the Sum of Fourty thouſand pound, parcel of the moneys raiſed by the ſaid Act, was at that time actually in the hands of the ſaid <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> (which he did acknowledge ſo to be) and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the ſaid Sum ſhould be payed to the ſaid Merchants in part of Satisfaction for the ſaid Stores, which they did furniſh upon the credit of the ſaid Affirmation and undertaking. He the ſaid <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> did on or about the year One thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy eight, iſſue out and pay the ſaid Sum to the Victuallers of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy by way of advance, and for proviſions not then brought in, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true intent and meaning of the ſaid Act; Whereas the ſame by the proviſion of the ſaid Act, ought to have been payed to the Eaſt-land Merchants, who had furniſhed His Majeſty with Flax, Hemp, and other Neceſſaries for the ſaid Service; Of which ſaid Deceit and Injuſtice the ſaid Merchants did complain in the laſt Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the ſaid <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> being Treaſurer of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and then and ſtill having a Salary of 3000<hi>l. per Annum</hi> clear
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:187922:34"/>for the ſame, did, during the time that he was Speaker of the late long Parliament, receive out of the monies appointed for ſecret Service, the Yearly Sum of 3000<hi>l.</hi> over and above his ſaid Salary which was conſtantly payed to him, as well during the Intervals as the Seſſions of Parliament; and particularly, during the Prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fifteen months.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That on or about the Eighteenth year of His Majeſties Reign, and during a War with the States General of the United <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands;</hi> He the ſaid <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> being then one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Prize Goods, did, Fradulently, Unlawfully, and in Deceipt of His Majeſty, Unlade a certain Prize Ship, taken from the Subjects of the ſaid States, without any Order or Authority for the ſame, and did Houſe the Lading and Goods of the ſaid Ship, and Lock up the ſame without the preſence of any Store-keeper, and did afterwards ſell the ſame, pretending the ſame to be only <hi>Muſcarado</hi> Sugars, and did account with His Majeſty for the ſame as ſuch; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Truth, the ſaid Ship was Laden with <hi>Cochineal</hi> and <hi>Indico,</hi> Rich Merchandiſes of a very great Value.</p>

Their Oppoſers they have found means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and if they were Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, or other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to have them turned out of Commiſſion; and in contempt of the known Laws of the Land they have practiſed upon people of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After ſometime they became able to influence matters of State and Government, and thereby to deſtroy thoſe they cannot corrupt. The
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:187922:38"/>continuance or Prorogation of Parliaments has been accommodated to ſerve the purpoſes of that Party. Money raiſed upon the People to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your Majeſties extraordinary Occaſions, was by the preva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ence of Popiſh Councils imployed to make War upon a Proteſtant State, and to advance and augment the dreadfull Power of the French King though to the apparent hazard of this, and all other Proteſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Great numbers of your Majeſties Subjects were ſent into, and continued in the ſervice of that King, notwithſtanding the apparent Intereſt of your Majeſties Kingdoms, the Addreſſes of the Parliament, and your Majeſties gracious Proclamations to the contrary. Nor can We forbear to mention, how that at the beginning of the ſame War, even the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> were made Inſtruments to preſs upon that State, the acceptance of one demand, among others, from the French King for procuring their peace with him, that they ſhould admit the publick exerciſe of the Roman Catholick Religion in the United Provinces, the Churches there to be divided, and the Romiſh Prieſts maintained out of the publick Revenue.</p>
                     <p>At home, if Your Majeſty did at any time by the Advice of Your Privy-Council, or of Your two Houſes of Parliament, Command the Laws to be put in Execution againſt Papiſts, even from thence they gained advantage to their Party, while the edge of thoſe Laws was turned againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters, and the Papiſts eſcaped in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner untoucht. The Act of Parliament, enjoining a Teſt to be taken by all Perſons admitted into any Publick Office and intended for a ſecurity againſt Papiſts comeing into Employment, had ſo little effect, that either by Diſpenſation, obtained from <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſubmitted to thoſe Teſts, and held their Offices themſelves, or thoſe put in their places, were ſo favourable to the ſame Intereſts, that Popery it ſelf has rather gained than loſt ground ſince that Act.</p>
                     <p>But that their buſineſs in hand might yet more ſpeedily and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed, at length a Popiſh Secretary (ſince Executed for his Treaſons) takes upon him to ſet a foot and maintain correſponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eies at <hi>Rome</hi> (particularly with a Native Subject of Your Majeſties, promoted to be a Cardinal) and in the Courts of other Foreign Princes (to uſe their own form of Speech) for the ſubduing that Peſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:187922:39"/>Hereſie, which has ſo long domineered over this Northern World; that is, to root the Proteſtant Religion out of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby to make way the more eaſily to do the ſame in other Proteſtant Countries.</p>
                     <p>Towards the doing this great Work, (as Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was pleaſed to called it) Jeſuits (the moſt dangerous of all Popiſh Orders to the Lives and Eſtates of Princes) were diſtributed to their ſeveral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts within this Kingdom, and held joint Councils with thoſe of the ſame Order in all Neighbour Popiſh Countries: Out of theſe Councils and correſpondencies was hatcht that damnable and helliſh Plot, by the good Providence of Almighty God brought to light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two Years ſince, but ſtill threatning us; wherein the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors impatient of longer delay, reckoning the prolonging of Your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſties Life (which God long Preſerve) as the Great Obſtacle in the way to the Conſummation of their hopes, and having in their proſpect a Proſelyted Prince immediately to ſucceed in the Throne of theſe Kingdoms, reſolved to begin their Work with the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Your Majeſty, to carry it on with Armed Force, to deſtroy Your Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> to Execute a ſecond Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo with eaſe to arrive at the Suppreſſion of our Religion, and the Subverſion of the Government.</p>
                     <p>When this Accurſed Conſpiracy began to be diſcovered, they began the ſmothering it with the Barbarous Murther of a Juſtice of the Peace, within one of Your Majeſties own Pallaces, who had taken ſome Examinations concerning it.</p>
                     <p>Amidſt theſe diſtractions and fears, Popiſh Officers, for the Command of Forces were allowed upon the Muſters by ſpecial Orders (ſurreptitiouſly obtained from Your Majeſty) but Counter-Signed by a Secretary of State without ever paſſing under the Teſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the aforementioned Act of Parliament. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner above fifty new Commiſſions were granted about the ſame time to known Papiſts, beſides a great number of deſperate Popiſh Officers, though out of Command, yet entertained at half pay. When in the next Parliament the Houſe of Commons were prepared to bring to a legal Tryal the principal Conſpirators in this Plot, that Parliament was firſt Prorogued, and then Diſſolved. The Interval between the Calling and Sitting of this Parliament was ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:187922:39"/>long, that now they conceive hopes of Covering all their paſt Crimes and gained a ſeaſonable time and advantages of practiſing them more effectually.</p>
                     <p>Witneſſes are attempted to be corrupted, and not only promiſes of Reward, but of the Favour of Your Majeſties Brother, made the Motives to their Compliance. Divers of the moſt conſiderable of Your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects have Crimes of the higheſt nature forged againſt them, the Charge to be ſupported by Subornation and Perjury, that they may be deſtroyed by Forms of Law and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>A Preſentment being prepared for a Grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Your Majeſties ſaid Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> (under whoſe Countenance all the reſt ſhelter themſelves) the Grand Jury were in an unheard of, and unpreſidented, and illegal manner diſcharged; and that with ſo much haſte, and fear leſt they ſhould finiſh that <hi>Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that they were prevented from delivering many other <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> by them at that time found againſt other Popiſh Recuſants. Becauſe a Pamphlet came forth Weekly, called, <hi>The Weekly Packet of Advice from Rome,</hi> which expoſes Popery (as it deſerves) as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the people, a new and arbitrary Rule of Court was made in Your Majeſties Court of Kings Bench (rather like a Star-Chamber, than a Court of Law) That the ſame ſhould not for the future be Printed by any perſon whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>We acknowledge Your Majeſties Grace and Care in iſſuing forth divers Proclamations ſince the Diſcovery of the Plot, for the Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papiſts from about this Great City, and Reſidence of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Court, and the Parliament; but with trouble of mind We do humbly inform Your Majeſty, That notwithſtanding all theſe prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, great Numbers of them, and of the moſt dangerous ſort, to the Terrour of Your Majeſties Ptoteſtant Subjects, do daily reſort hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and abide here.

But our only Hope, next under God, is in Your Sacred Majeſty, That by Your Great Wiſdom and Goodneſs, We may be effectually ſecured from Popery, and all the Evils that attend it, and that none but perſons of known Fidelity to Your Majeſty, and Sincere Affections to the Proteſtant Religion, may be put into any Employment, Civil or Military; that whilſt We ſhall give a Supply to <hi>Tangier,</hi> We may be aſſured, We do not Augment the Strength of our Popiſh Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, nor encreaſe our own Dangers.

                     <p>UPON conſideration of the information given at the Bar by Mr. <hi>Peter Norris</hi> and Referred to this Committee,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſolved,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this Committee, that the Examination of this matter be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Specially.</p>
                     <p>This Committee in the firſt place, after hearing of the ſaid <hi>Norris</hi> his Complaint, that ſeveral Papers were taken from him, ſent for the ſaid Papers which were informed then to be in a Cheſt in the Council Chamber, which Papers were brought to this Committee by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory which the ſaid <hi>Norris</hi> then acknowledged to be all, and they ſtill remain with this Committee.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, they proceeded to examine upon what occaſion the ſaid <hi>Norris</hi> was ſent beyond Sea, which not only by the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but alſo by a Certificate delivered to the Chairman of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and divers other Informations as well as the ſaid <hi>Norris</hi> his Inſtructions given by Dr. <hi>Tonge,</hi> was to fetch over one <hi>Dowdall</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſt, who had been converſant with the Prieſts in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> who managed the Plot both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and mixing himſelf among them, was privy to the whole Plot, which the ſaid <hi>Dowdall</hi> by ſeveral Letters had made known to Dr. <hi>Tonge,</hi> which Letters were peruſed by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and alſo ſatisfaction was given by a known Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> that the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:187922:60"/>ſaid <hi>Dowdall</hi> was an honeſt man, of good underſtanding, and might be credited.</p>
                     <p>Then the Committee proceeded to inquire, who at any time had knowledge of the ſending over for the ſaid <hi>Dowdall,</hi> and found by an Order of Council, bearing date the eighteenth day of <hi>July</hi> 1679. that the ſaid <hi>Dowdall</hi> by the name of <hi>Edward Dowdall,</hi> was permitted to come from <hi>Dover</hi> and ſtay for a Month, but in that Order there is no mention of <hi>Dowdall's</hi> being a Prieſt. And it likewiſe appears to this Committee, that not long after the ſaid Order for his coming over, <hi>Dowdall</hi> dyed, and not without ſuſpicion that it was a violent Death: But it doth not appear to this Committee, that the Death of <hi>Dowdall</hi> was known in <hi>England</hi> till after the return of <hi>Norris,</hi> who was ſent to fetch the ſaid <hi>Dowdall</hi> over, which was about Ten months after the Date of the ſaid Order of Council.</p>
                     <p>Upon which, this Committee proceeded to Examine, how it came to paſs, that the ſaid <hi>Norris</hi> was in ſuch danger beyond Sea; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at his coming aboard the Pacquett-Boat at <hi>Calais,</hi> and likewiſe his Impriſonment at <hi>Dover</hi> in the common Priſon, and his being brought from <hi>Dover</hi> by a Meſſenger, and they found the Cauſe of it to be a Diſcription given of <hi>Peter Norris</hi> to Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> the Twenty Ninth of <hi>May</hi> 1680. in theſe words, Peter Norris, <hi>ſome call him</hi> Morris <hi>a</hi> Scotch-man, <hi>handſome, neat Face, ſanguine Complexion, ſhort Noſe, bald-pated, white Wigg, ſlender Body, little Stature, Civil and Smooth in Diſcourſe, ſpeaking</hi> French, <hi>aged Thirty four Years more or leſs, Taylor by Trade:</hi> and under this Deſcription, written with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand and Ink theſe words <hi>(viz.) Went into</hi> France <hi>on</hi> Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>was three weeks to bring with him a Prieſt.</hi> Thereupon this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee proceeded to Examine, who brought this Deſcription to the ſaid Secretary, and were and by whom it was drawn, with all the Circumſtances that they could find about it. And firſt they found, that <hi>Thomas Sheridon</hi> a Gentleman, who affirmed himſelf a Proteſtant born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> heretofore employed in Collecting the Revenues there, and lately with the Duke at his Court at <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and came over with him in the ſame Yacht, confeſſed upon his Examination, that he carryed the ſaid Deſcription to the ſaid Secretary; but it being
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:187922:61"/>ſhewed him, he denyed the writing any part of it ſave the laſt Line; but confeſſed that it was written and brought to him by one <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Day</hi> Doctor of Phyſick to the late Army in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſaid <hi>Sheridon</hi> was commanded to produce the ſaid <hi>Day,</hi> and with him to attend.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Day</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sheridon</hi> both appearing were examined ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>And firſt the ſaid <hi>Day,</hi> who confeſt himſelf a Papiſt, and pretended very little knowledg of Mr. <hi>Sheridon,</hi> but that coming to give him a viſit, which he had not done of ſix weeks before, Mr. <hi>Sheridon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcourſe of News, and particularly of the Plot; to which the ſaid Doctor replyed, that now the whole Plot would be diſcovered &amp; laid open; for he heard there was one gone beyond Sea to fetch over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a Prieſt that knew of the whole Plot: and doth not remember any thing more at that time but common diſcourſe. But ſome few days after meeting with Mr. <hi>Sheridon,</hi> the ſaid Mr. <hi>Sheridon</hi> deſired him to deſcribe the perſon that was ſo ſent over; the ſaid Dr. <hi>Day</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he knew not the perſon that was gone, nor the Prieſt he was to fetch: But that <hi>John Butler,</hi> keeper of a Brandy-ſhop near the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadours upon diſcourſe had told him ſo; to whom Mr. <hi>Sheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> deſired him to go and get the diſcription, which he did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And the deſcription being ſhewed him, confeſſed he writ it from his mouth, ſave the laſt line: But ſaith, that perſon is now dead who gave him the ſaid Deſcription, but his wife is living.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Sheridon</hi> being then called in and examined, ſaid, He had no great acquaintance with the ſaid Doctor, and ſeldom ſaw him but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a viſit, which happily might be once a week or the like; Confeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That the ſaid Doctor told him as News, the Plot would now be laid open, for there was one ſent over into <hi>France</hi> to fetch a Prieſt that knew of the whole Plot: and further ſaith, That he that went over knew as much of the Plot as any man in <hi>England.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſaid <hi>Sheridon</hi> Confeſſeth, That he went ſhortly after, but remembers not how long, to Secretary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> and told him that there was one gone over into <hi>France</hi> that knew as much of the Plot as any man, and that he went over to fetch a Prieſt that alſo knew the whole Plot, which he the ſaid <hi>Sheridon</hi> ſuppoſed was to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:187922:61"/>Upon which the ſaid Secretary commanded him the ſaid <hi>Sheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to give him a deſcription of the perſon ſo ſent over: But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers no other diſcourſe at that time; but that ſome ſhort time after, but remembers not how long, he met with Mr. <hi>Day,</hi> who gave him the deſcription in the preſence of Mr. <hi>John Wilſon</hi> of the <hi>Middle Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which he ſhortly after delivered to the Secretary, and uſed as he remembers, only theſe words, Sir, here is the diſcription of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I mentioned to you.</p>

                     <p>But with grief of Heart we cannot but obſerve, that to theſe Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Offers, Your Majeſty has been Adviſed (by what ſecret Enemies to Your Majeſty and Your People we know not) to annex a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which if inſiſted on, in the inſtance to which alone it is applicable, will render all Your Majeſties other Gracious Inclinations of no effect or advantage to us. Your Majeſty is pleaſed thus to limit Your promiſe of concurrence in the Remedies which ſhall be propoſed, that they may conſiſt with preſerving the Succeſſion of the Crown in its due and legal courſe of Deſcent. And we do Humbly inform Your Majeſty, that no Interruption of that Deſcent has been endeavoured by us, except onely the Deſcent upon the Perſon of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who by the wicked Inſtruments of the Church of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:187922:66"/>
                        <hi>Rome,</hi> has been manifeſtly perverted to their Religion. And we do Humbly repreſent to Your Majeſty, as the Iſſue of our moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Thoughts and Conſultations, that for the Papiſts to have their hopes continued that a Prince of that Religion ſhall ſucceed in the Throne of theſe Kingdoms, is utterly inconſiſtent with the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Your Majeſties Perſon, the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Proſperity, Peace and Welfare of Your Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
                     <p>That Your Majeſties Sacred Life is in continual danger, under the proſpect of a Popiſh Succeſſor, is evident, not onely from the pinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe devoted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which allow that an Heretical Prince (and ſuch they term all Proteſtant Princes) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and Depoſed by the Pope, may be deſtroyed and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd; but alſo from the Teſtimonies given in the proſecution of the Horrid <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> againſt divers Traitors Attainted for deſigning to put thoſe accurſed principles into practice againſt Your Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>From the expectation of this Succeſſion, has the number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in Your Majeſties Dominions ſo much encreaſed within theſe few years, and ſo many been prevailed with to deſert the true Proteſtant Religion, that they might be prepared for the Favours of a <hi>Popiſt</hi>-Prince; aſſoon as he ſhould come to the poſſeſſion of the Crown: And while the ſame Expectation laſts, many more will be in the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being perverted.</p>
                     <p>This it is that has hardened the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of this Kingdom, animated and confederated by their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> to make a Common purſe, provide Arms, make application to Forreign Princes, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite their Aid, for impoſing Popery upon us; And all this even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Majeſty's Reign, and while your Majeſty's Government, and the Laws were our protection.</p>
                     <p>It is Your Majeſtie's Glory and true Intereſt, to be the Head and Protector of all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as well abroad as at home: But if theſe hopes remain, what Alliances can be made for the advantage of the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt, which ſhall give confidence to your Majeſty's Allies, to join ſo vigorouſly with Your Majeſty, as the State of that Intereſt in the world now requires, while they ſee this <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Kingdom</hi> in ſo much danger of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor; by whom
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:187922:66"/>at the preſent, all their Councils and Actions may be eluded, as hitherto they have been, and by whom (if he ſhould ſucceed) they are ſure to be deſtroyed?</p>
                     <p>We have this humbly laid before yout Majeſty, ſome of thoſe great Dangers and miſchiefs which evidently accompany the expectation of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor.</hi> The certain and unſpeakable Evils which will come upon your Majeſty's <hi>Proteſtant Subjects</hi> and their Poſterity, if ſuch a Prince ſhould inherit, are more alſothan we can well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Our Religion, which is now ſo dangerouſly ſhaken, will then be totally overthrown; Nothing will beleft, or can be found to protect or defend it.</p>
                     <p>The execution of old Laws muſt ceaſe, and it will be vain to expect new ones. The moſt ſacred Obligations of Contracts and promiſes (if any ſhould be given) that ſhall be judged to be againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> will be violated; as is undeniable, not only from Argument and experience elſewhere, but from the ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience this Nation once had on the like occaſion.</p>
                     <p>In the Reign of ſuch a Prince, the Pope will be acknowledged Supream (though the Subjects of this Kingdom have ſworn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) and all Cauſes, either as Spiritual, or in order to Spiritual Things, will be brought under his Juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>The Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates of all ſuch <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as value their Souls and their Religion more than their ſecular Concernments, will be adjudged forfeited,</p>

                        </gap>o this we might add: That it appears in the diſcovery of the Plot, that Forreign Princes, were invited to aſſiſt in ſecuring the Crown to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> with arguments from his great Zeal to eſtabliſh Popery, and to extirpate Proteſtants (whom they call <hi>Hereticks</hi>) out of his Dominions; and ſuch will expect performance accordingly.</p>
                     <p>We further humbly beſeech your Majeſty, in your great wiſdom to conſider, whether in caſe the Imperial Crown of this Proteſtant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhould deſcend to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> the oppoſition which may poſſibly be made to his poſſeſſing it, may not only endanger the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſcent in the Royal Line, but even Monarchy it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>And this Committee admiring that Proteſtant Judges ſhould take offence againſt a Book whoſe chief deſign was to expoſe the Cheats and Foppery of Popery, enquired further into it, and found by the Evidence of <hi>Jane Curtis,</hi> that the ſaid Book had been Licens'd for ſeveral Months, that her Huſband paid for the Coppy, and enter'd it in the Hall-Book of the Company: But for all this ſhe could not prevail by theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> to permit it any longer; who ſaid, 'Twas a Scandalous Libel, and againſt the King's Proclamation, and he would ruine her if ever ſhe printed it any more: And ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:187922:71"/>ſhe was ſerved with the ſaid Rule, as the Author and other Printers were; and by the Author's Evidence it appears, That he was taken and brought before the ſaid Chief Juſtice by his Warrant above a year ſince, &amp; upon his owning he writ part of that Book, the Chief Juſtice called him Rogue, and other ill names; ſaying he would fill all the Goals in <hi>England</hi> with ſuch Rogues, and pile them up as men do Faggots; and ſo Committed him to priſon, refuſing ſufficient Bayl, and ſaying, he would Goal him to put him to Charges; and his Lordſhip obſerved his word punctually therin, forcing him to his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and then taking the ſame Bayl he refuſed before; upon which, this Committee came to this Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That it is the opinion of the Committee, That the Rule made by the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in Trinity Term laſt, againſt print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Book called, <hi>The Weekly Pacquet of Advice from</hi> Rome, is Alegal and Arbitrary.</p>
                     <p>And the Committee proceeded further, and upon Information that a very great latitude had been taken of late by the Judges, in impoſing Fines on the perſons found Guilty before them, cauſed a Tranſcript of all the Fines impoſed by the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> ſince <hi>Eaſter-Term</hi> in the 28th. of His Majeſties Reign, to be brought before them from the ſaid Court by <hi>Samuel Aſtrey</hi> Gent: by peruſal of which, it appear'd to this Committee, That the quality of the offence, and the Ability of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon found Guilty, have not been the Meaſures that have determined the quantity of many of theſe Fines, which being ſo very numerous, the Committee refer themſelves to thoſe Records as to the general, inſtancing in ſome particulars, as followeth.</p>

                     <p>Upon Conſideration whereof, this Committee came to this Reſolution:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> (in the Impoſition of Fines on Offenders of late years) hath acted Arbitrarily, Illegally and Partially, favouring Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and perſons Popiſhly affected, and exceſſively oppreſſing His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
                     <p>And this Committee being inform'd, That ſeveral of His Majeſties Subjects had been committed for crimes baylable by Law, although they then tendred ſufficient ſureties, which were refus'd, only to put them to vexation and charge, proceeded to enquire into the ſame, and found that not only the foremention'd <hi>Henry Carr</hi> had been ſo refus'd the common Right of a Subject, as is aboveſaid; but that <hi>George Broome</hi> being a Conſtable laſt year in <hi>London,</hi> and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> Servants for great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, according to his Duty, he was in few days arreſted by a Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, without any <hi>London</hi> Conſtable, and carried before the ſaid Chief Juſtice by His Warrant, to anſwer for the committing of thoſe perſons aboveſaid; but being there, was accuſed of having ſpoken irreverently of the ſaid Chief Juſtice; and an <hi>Affidavit</hi> read to him to that purpoſe, which was falſly (as the ſaid <hi>George Broome</hi> affirms
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:187922:73"/>Sworn againſt him by two perſons that uſe to be Common Bayl in that Court, and of very ill reputation. Upon which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> though he then tendred two able Citizens and Common-Council men of <hi>London</hi> to be his Bayle: and he was forc't to bring his <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to his great charge before he came out; when the Marſhall, Mr. <hi>Cooling,</hi> exacted 5 <hi>l.</hi> of him; of which he complain'd to the Chief Juſtice, but had no other Anſwer, but he might take his Remedy at Law. But the ſaid Marſhall fearing he ſhould be queſtioned, reſtor'd him two <hi>Guineys</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>And further this Committee was inform'd by <hi>Francis Smith,</hi> Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, That about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> was Twelvemonth he was brought before the ſaid Chief Juſtice by his Warrant, and charged by the Meſſenger, <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> That he had ſeen ſome parcels of a Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, call'd <hi>Obſervations on Sir</hi> George Wakeman<hi>'s Tryal,</hi> in his Shop: Upon which the Chief Juſtice told him, he would make him an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; uſe him like a Boar in <hi>France,</hi> and pile him and all the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers and Printers up in Priſon, like Faggots; and ſo Committed him to the <hi>Kings-Bench:</hi> Swearing and Curſing at him in great fury. And when he tendred three ſufficient Citizens of <hi>London</hi> for his Bail, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Impriſonment in his Circumſtances would be his utter ruine, the Chief Juſtice replied, the Citizens lookt like ſufficent perſons, but he would take no bail; and ſo he was forc'd to come out by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and was afterwards informed againſt for the ſame matter, to his great charge and vexation. And a while after <hi>Francis</hi> (the Son of the ſaid <hi>Francis Smith</hi>) was committed by the ſaid Chief Juſtice, &amp; bail refus'd, for ſelling a Pamphlet call'd, <hi>A New years gift</hi> for the ſaid Chief Juſtice, to a Coffee-houſe; and he declared to them he would take no bail, for he would ruine them all.</p>
                     <p>And further it appear'd to this Committee, that the ſaid Chief Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice (about <hi>October</hi> was twelve month) committed in like manner <hi>Jane Curtis,</hi> ſhe having a husband and children, for ſelling a Book call'd <hi>A Satyr againſt injuſtice,</hi> which his Lordſhip call'd a Libel againſt him; and her friends tendring ſufficient Bail, and deſiring to have mercy on her poverty, and condition; he ſwore by the name of God ſhe ſhould go to priſon; and he would ſhew no more mercy than they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from a Wolf that came to devour them; and ſhe might bring
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:187922:74"/>her <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> and come out ſo: Which ſhe was forc'd to do; and after inform'd againſt and proſecuted to her utter ruin, four or five Terms after.</p>
                     <p>In like manner it appeared to this Committee, that about that time alſo, <hi>Edward Berry</hi> (Stationer of <hi>Grays Inn</hi>) was committed by the ſaid Chief Juſtice, being accus'd of ſelling <hi>The Obſervations on Sir</hi> George Wakeman's <hi>Tryal;</hi> and though he tendred 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Bail, yet the Chief Juſtice ſaid, he would take no Bail, he ſhould go to Priſon, and come out according to Law. And after he with much trouble and Charge got out by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> he was forc'd by himſelf, or His Attorney, to attend five Terms before he could be diſcharged, though no information was exhibited againſt him in all that time. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, and of others of the like Nature, (too tedious here to relate) this Committee came to this Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſolved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the refuſing ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bail in theſe Caſes, wherein the perſons Committed were Baila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Law; was Illegal, and a High Breach of the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>And this Committee being Informed of an extraordinary kind of a Charge, given at the laſt Aſſizes at <hi>Kingſton</hi> (in the County of <hi>Surrey</hi>) by Mr. <hi>Baron Weſton,</hi> and proceeding to examine ſeveral perſons then and there preſent; It was made appear to this Committee, by the Teſtimony of <hi>John Cole, Richard Mayo,</hi> and <hi>John Peirce,</hi> Gentlemen, and others (ſome of whom put down the ſaid Barons words in writing immediately) that part of the ſaid Charge was to this effect: He inveighed very much againſt <hi>Farel, Luther, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> condemning them as Authors of the Reformation: which was againſt their Princes minds, and then adding to this purpoſe, <hi>Zuinglius ſet up his Fanaticiſme, and</hi> Calvin <hi>built on that bleſſed Foundation: And to ſpeak truth, all his Diſciples are ſeaſoned with ſuch a ſharpneſs of ſpirit, that it much concerns Magiſtrates to keep a ſtrait hand over them: And now they are reſtleſs, amuſing us with fears, and nothing will ſerve them but a Parliament: For my part, I know no Repreſentative of the Nation but the King; all power Centers in him: 'Tis true, he does intruſt it with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:187922:74"/>his Miniſters. but he is the ſole Repreſentative; and I faith, he has wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enough to intruſt it no more in theſe men, who have given us ſuch late Examples of their wiſdom and Faithfulneſs.</hi> And this Committee taking the ſaid matter into their Conſideration, came to this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſolved,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it is the Opinion of this Committee, that the ſaid Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Charge given by the ſaid <hi>Baron Weſton,</hi> were a Scandal to the Reformation, in Derogation of the Rights and Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and tending to raiſe Diſcord between his Majeſty and his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>And this Committee being Informed by ſeveral Printers and Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, of great Trouble and Vexation given them unjuſtly by one <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> (called a Meſſenger of the Preſs) the ſaid <hi>Stephens</hi> being Examined by this Committee, by what Authority he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in that manner, Produced two Warrants under the hand and Seal of the Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> which were, <hi>In hac verba:</hi>

Upon which the Chief Juſtice fell into a great Paſſion; and there is ſome reaſon to believe, that ſoon after he made an ill Repreſentation of what the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert</hi> had then ſpoke unto his Majeſtie.

                     <p>And this Committee proceeded further to inquire into ſome Paſſages that happened at <hi>Lent Aſſizes</hi> laſt for the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> at the Tryal of <hi>Thomas Dare</hi> Gent. there, upon an Indictment for ſaying falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeditiouſly, <hi>That the Subjects had but two means to Redreſs their Grievances, One by Petitioning, the Other by Rebellion:</hi> And found, that though by his other diſcourſe when he ſaid ſo, that it appeared plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had no rebellious intent, in that he ſaid, <hi>Then God forbid there ſhould be a Rebellion, he would be the firſt man to draw his Sword againſt a Rebel;</hi> yet he was profecuted with great violence: And having pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> he moved Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> (who then ſat Judge there) that he might try it at the next <hi>Aſſiſes,</hi> for that Mr. <hi>Searle</hi> (who was by at the ſpeaking of the words, and a material Witneſs for his defence) was not then to be had, and an <hi>Affidavit</hi> to that purpoſe was made and recieved. But the ſaid Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> told him, That was a favour of the Court onely, and he had not deſerved any Favour, and ſo forc'd him to try it preſently.

And further affirmed, That the Church of Rome was the True Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. He further endeavoured to prove Extream Unction, and Auricular Confeſſion, as well as he could, out of the Epiſtles. Further, he hath heard him ſay, The King was a Perſon of mean and ſoft Temper, and could be led eaſily to any thing, but yet a <hi>Solomon</hi> in vices; but that the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was a Prince of a brave Spirit, would
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:187922:81"/>be faithful to his Friends, and that it was our own Faults that he was a Roman Catholick, in that we forc't him to fly into <hi>France</hi> where he imbraced that Religion: About the ſame time, he the ſaid <hi>Thompſon,</hi> ſaid the Church would be Militant, but greatly commended the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Solemnizing the Maſs in <hi>France;</hi> and that it was performed with much more Reverence and Devotion then any other Religion doth uſe. He further heard him ſay in a Sermon, about the time of Petitioning, he would rather cut off his hand then Sign it; and had many bad expreſſions of it that it was the Seed of Rebellion and like 40 and 41. And further, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> at one <hi>Sanford's</hi> Shop door in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Bedlow,</hi> ſaid, That he was not to be believ'd, becauſe <hi>Bedlow</hi> had ſaid he, meaning Mr. <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> ſaid he was not; and that <hi>Bedlow</hi> was of a bad Life and in many Plots, and not to be credited in any thing he ſaid: And that in another Diſcourſe he commended the Romiſh Clergy for their ſingle Life and is himſelf ſo; and did at the ſame time Vilify &amp; Rail at the Engliſh Clergy for Marrying; ſaying it was better for a Clergy Man to be Guelt, then to Marry, &amp; that the Calviniſts in <hi>France</hi> were Lecherous Fellows, and could ſcarce be two years a Prieſt without a Wife. About the time, and after the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> to this Parliament, Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> ſaid he was not fit to be believ'd, and as bad as any Fanatick.
